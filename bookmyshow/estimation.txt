Peak Read QPS (Queries per second)

Users search for movies, venues, and seat availability.
Assume 100M searches per day, 5M during peak hours.
Peak Read QPS = 5M / (60 * 60) ≈ 1400 QPS
Assume each search triggers 5 DB calls.
Total DB Read QPS = 1400 * 5 = 7000 QPS



Peak Write QPS (Ticket Booking)

Assume 100K bookings per minute during peak hours.
Peak Write QPS = (100K / 60) ≈ 1667 QPS.
Each booking involves:
Seat reservation
Payment processing
Confirmation & notification
Total Write QPS ≈ 2000 QPS



Booking Data Storage
Each booking stores:

UserID (8 bytes)
ShowID (8 bytes)
TheaterID (8 bytes)
Seats (3 seats × 4 bytes = 12 bytes)
Timestamp (8 bytes)
Total per booking ≈ 44 bytes
Daily bookings: 5M
Yearly bookings: 1.8B
Storage needed per year: 1.8B × 44 bytes ≈ 80GB (without indexing, replication, etc.)
With replication (×3), indices, and logs → ~1TB per year.
