Users: 50M monthly active users (MAU)
Peak traffic: 5M daily active users (DAU)
Peak bookings: 100K bookings per minute (during peak times)

Cities covered: ~300 cities
Total cinemas: ~5000 cinemas
Total screens: ~15,000 screens
Showtimes per screen/day: ~5 showtimes
Seats per screen: ~200 seats


Estimating Daily Traffic
Assuming:

100M monthly active users (MAUs)
Peak traffic during movie releases
Average ticket bookings per user per month = 5
Daily active users (DAU) ≈ 10M (10% of MAUs)
Average number of bookings per second:
100𝑀×5 / 30×24×3600≈200fTPS (Transactions Per Second)

Peak traffic can be 10x normal → ~2000 TPS during peak hours.

Booking Data Storage
Each booking stores:

UserID (8 bytes)
ShowID (8 bytes)
TheaterID (8 bytes)
Seats (3 seats × 4 bytes = 12 bytes)
Timestamp (8 bytes)
Total per booking ≈ 44 bytes
Daily bookings: 5M
Yearly bookings: 1.8B
Storage needed per year: 1.8B × 44 bytes ≈ 80GB (without indexing, replication, etc.)
With replication (×3), indices, and logs → ~1TB per year.
