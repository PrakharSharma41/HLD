REQUIREMENTS:
1. 100kTPS
2. send tramsfers between accounts
3. variations: strong read consistency
4. auditing


approach 1: 
use cdc, aws steps(similar to saga), dynamodb(prefer sql)

use OLTP database for transactions
An OLTP database is designed for fast, real-time transactional queries, such as inserts, updates, and deletes. It is optimized for high concurrency and quick response times.
High Throughput & Low Latency → Handles millions of short, fast transactions per second.
Normalized Data Model → Uses SQL (Relational Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL) to maintain data integrity.
ACID Compliance → Ensures Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability for reliable transactions.


use OLAP database for auditing
An OLAP database is designed for complex queries, data aggregation, and analytics rather than transactional workloads. Unlike OLTP databases,
 which handle fast read/write operations for transactions

transaction db:
sender_id,transaction_id(partition key),receiver_id,amount,timestamp,status:Received/Complete

AWS steps:
it can also be used to do several steps, it is similar to AWS lambda function
but it does several steps and its really good at retries
