we can use apache cassandra here.

The nodes in Cassandra communicate with each other using the gossip protocol. 
Apache Cassandra supports automatic partitioning of the database using consistent hashing. 

The downside of this approach is that the data consistency of the distributed counter cannot be guaranteed.

The problems with the Cassandra counter are the following:

the counter column can only exist in a separate table with entirely counter columns
the counter table with at least one counter column can never be deleted
the counter update operations are not idempotent


in cassaandra we could  have used COUNTER, which is  internally implemented as to increase the value and replicate it 
efficiently but it has some problems:
1. No mixed data types	If a table has a counter, all non-PK columns must be counters
2. No deletes of individual rows	Due to internal increment history tracking
3. Not idempotent	Retrying the same increment may double-count!

It is also not preferred approach for this system.

Example scenario:
You have a post with post_id=1 and like_count=100.

You DELETE the row because you removed the post.

Node B didn’t receive the delete yet and still has +100 locally.

Later, you run a repair or nodes reconcile during read repairs → Node B sends its +100 increments.

Now, your deleted post shows like_count=100 again, even though you explicitly deleted it.

Why can’t Cassandra avoid this?
Counters are append-only under the hood: they don’t store the absolute value but the deltas (increments/decrements).

There’s no absolute “final value” to overwrite like normal columns — so when nodes sync, old increments can be added again.


⚙️ How Cassandra Counters Work Internally
Cassandra uses distributed counters implemented using a variation of PN-Counters under the hood:

Each node maintains a local shard of the counter.

Nodes track increments and decrements separately (just like PN-Counter).

When reading the counter value, it sums all the deltas across replicas.

🔄 Replication and Conflict Resolution
Each replica stores a (replica_id, delta) pair.

During read or repair, Cassandra merges values using last-write-wins per replica, ensuring eventual consistency.
