approach:
1. push based
2. pull based
3. sync vs async
4. continuous
5. data warehouse

push based:
daemon agent running on prod pushes data to collection service
and daemon agent is responsible for retries in this case
daemon agent is responsible for the offset till which collection service has read
batched up logs are sent to collection service
logs data store here is  elasticsearch:
{
    log_message: "error: failed error here"
    timestamp: 1234567
    logging_level: fatal/error/info
}

pull based:
collection service is responsible to retry in this case
in pull based collection service needs to know about each daemon agent which
can be an issues
collection service would need to scale with the daemon agent since it is 
consuming from all daemon agent which can be a problem


message broker:
daemon agents sends data to collection service which can then submit to
kafka which can scale for high throughput
