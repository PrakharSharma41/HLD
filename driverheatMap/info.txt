use quadtrees to store driver location

Quad Tree Implementation with Relational Databases (PostgreSQL + PostGIS)
Relational databases like PostgreSQL use GiST (Generalized Search Tree) indexes, which can be adapted to quad trees.

CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
CREATE TABLE locations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    geom GEOMETRY(Point, 4326)  -- Stores latitude/longitude points
);

Step 3: Create a Quad Tree-Based GiST Index
CREATE INDEX locations_gist ON locations USING GIST (geom);

SELECT * FROM locations
WHERE ST_Contains(ST_MakeEnvelope(-80, 25, -70, 35, 4326), geom);

Step 4: Perform a Range Query
SELECT * FROM locations
WHERE ST_Contains(ST_MakeEnvelope(-80, 25, -70, 35, 4326), geom);

Step 5: Find the Nearest Location
SELECT * FROM locations
ORDER BY geom <-> ST_GeomFromText('POINT(-75 30)', 4326)
LIMIT 1;
