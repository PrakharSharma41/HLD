1. Amazon has over 300 million active customers worldwide.

Assume 50% of users are monthly active → 150M MAU
Assume 10% are daily active → 30M DAU
Assume peak traffic is 5x the average → 150M peak requests/day


2. Number of Orders per Day
Suppose 5% of daily active users place an order.
That’s 1.5M orders/day.
Each order consists of multiple items:

Assume an average of 3 items per order → 4.5M items/day.
At peak hours (10% of the day), the system must handle:

150k orders per hour
2.5k orders per minute
40 orders per second

3. Read vs. Write Ratio
Assume:

50 reads per write (users browsing vs. ordering)
Orders/day = 1.5M writes
Total requests/day ≈ 75M writes + 3.75B reads
Peak request rate: 50K requests/sec

4. Storage Estimation
Each order stores:

1KB for order metadata
1KB per item
1.5M × (1KB + 3 × 1KB) = 6GB/day
For 10 years (with replication and indexing overhead, ~10x storage):

6GB × 365 × 10 × 10 ≈ 21.9PB
Assuming 20% orders contain images (e.g., receipts, invoices, product images), add another 10PB.

Total storage for orders ~32PB.
