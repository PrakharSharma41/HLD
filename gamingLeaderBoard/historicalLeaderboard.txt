The completed games can switch to REST instead of WebSocket streaming 20. The historical leaderboard can leverage a long TTL cache for scalability10.

Flow:
1. The client queries the DNS for identifying the closest data center
2. The extremely popular leaderboards can be queried from the CDN cache
3. The load balancer delegates the clientâ€™s request to a web server using the weighted-round robin algorithm
4. The web server invokes the serverless function to fetch the historical leaderboard
5. The serverless function queries the dedicated cache
6. The serverless function queries the read replica of the relational database on a cache miss
7. The profile image of the players can be fetched from the object storage
