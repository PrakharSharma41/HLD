we have flow for updating the score 

1. The client creates a WebSocket connection to the load balancer for real-time communication
2. The load balancer delegates the clientâ€™s request to the closest data center
3. The server updates the score on the sorted set data type in Redis
4. The serverless function updates the records on the relational database using the write-behind cache pattern


The serverless functions can be used to trigger the score update on the cache server and CDN through an event-driven architecture13.
