we want to avoid having to send each write through a single server before sending it off
to clients, or else that server will become a bottleneck

in CRDT, data can live on multiple servers such that when we eventually merge the crdts, all of
the nodes converge on the same data

crdt operations are idempotent, example:
insert x at position y, if we receive it multiple times, they should be performed only once

in this lets say we have 3 users and 3 servers a,b,c
each user sends request to different servers, now these servers need to sync as well.

so each server will have an entry containing last_server_event,server_id(default event is empty)

example:
A:  
last_server_event,serverB
last_server_event,serverC

when A receives events from C, lets say C1 and C2, it can be unordered also, so A will check
that if it receives C2, its last_server_event should be either C1, since it is null, it will
store C2 event till it processes C1 first and if C1 doesnt come, then it will call server C 
for event C1.
