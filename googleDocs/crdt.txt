we want to avoid having to send each write through a single server before sending it off
to clients, or else that server will become a bottleneck

in CRDT, data can live on multiple servers such that when we eventually merge the crdts, all of
the nodes converge on the same data

crdt operations are idempotent, example:
insert x at position y, if we receive it multiple times, they should be performed only once
