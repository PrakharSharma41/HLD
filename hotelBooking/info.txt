2. elastic search is used with search hostels to promote fuzzy search
and search with tags can also be done
3. booking service sends data to kafka that the room has been booked and 
dont show it in search 
4. archival data is send to cassandra since it has high throughput for
read and write and we can seach based on partiotion key(like booking id)
