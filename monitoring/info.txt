a monitoring system contains 5 components

• Data collection: collect metric data from different sources.
• Data transmission: transfer data from source lo the metrics monitoring system.
• Data storage: organize and store incoming data.
• Alerting: analyze incoming data,detect anomalies and genrate alerts. The system must be able to send alerts to differnet communication channels
• visualization: data in graphs etc 



according to DB-engines , the two most popular time-series databases are InfluxDB [15] and Prometheus,
which are designed to store large volumes of time-series data and quickly perform real- tim.e analysis on that data. 


we need to consider pull or push mode for metrics collector

for pull model:
metrics collector needs to know about dns of each service, we can use zookeepr for service discovery here
we can use multiple metrics collector, each metric collector collects metrics from a specific range of service

for push model:
In a push model, a collection agent is commonly installed on the server being monitored.
A collection agent is a piece of long running software that collects metrics from the services running on the server and 
push them to metrics collector.
