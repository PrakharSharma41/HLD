A time-series database (InfluxDB/TimescaleDB) is used to efficiently store and retrieve time-stamped server data.

A relational database is used to store alert rules, notifications, metadata of monitored servers, and some configuration information of the dashboard, etc.

Server Data (Saved to TSDB):

time (timestamp): The time the data point was recorded.
server_id (string): Identifier of the server from which the data originated.
cpu_usage (float): The CPU usage of the server at the recorded time.
memory_usage (float): The memory usage of the server at the recorded time.
disk_usage (float): The disk usage of the server at the recorded time.
system_logs (float): The network traffic on the server at the recorded time.
access_logs (text): Any access logs recorded at the time.
error_logs (text): Any error logs recorded at the time.
we can partition the data in our time-series database. Partitioning can be done based on time or server_id. 

Alerts Table (RDBMS):

alert_id (string): Unique identifier for each alert.
server_id (string): Identifier of the server associated with the alert.
rule_id (string): Identifier of the rule that triggered the alert.
time (timestamp): The time the alert was generated.
status (string): Status of the alert (e.g., "open", "acknowledged", "closed").

Rules Table (RDBMS):

rule_id (string): Unique identifier for each rule.
rule_name (string): Name of the rule.
rule_condition (string): The condition under which the rule triggers an alert.

Servers Table (RDBMS):

server_id (string): Unique identifier for each server.
server_name (string): Name of the server.
