Fanout service:

Fanout on read. The news feed is generated during read time. This is an on-demand model. Recent posts are pulled when a user loads her home page.
Fanout on write. With this approach, news feed is pre-computed during write time. A new post is delivered to friendsâ€™ cache immediately after it is published.
We adopt a hybrid approach to get benefits of both approaches and avoid pitfalls in them. Since fetching the news feed fast is crucial, we use a push model for the majority of users. 
For celebrities or users who have many friends/followers, we let followers pull news content on-demand to avoid system overload.
