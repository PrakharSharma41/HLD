Users: Assume the system serves 50 million daily users.

Notifications per user: On average, each user receives 5 notifications/day.

Peak load: Assume the peak time sees 1 million notifications within 1 minutes (a common scenario during flash sales, for example).

This means the system should handle:

Notifications per day: 50 million x 5 = 250 million notifications/day

Peak notifications per second: 1 million / 60 = ~17,000 notifications/second

Storage Requirements
Assuming average notification and user data size of 1KB.

Storage for user data: 50 million * 1 KB = 50GB

Daily Storage for notifications: 50 million * 5 * 1 KB = 250GB
