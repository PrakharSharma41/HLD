FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
payin flow: payment system receives money from customers
payout flow: payment system sends money to customers

NON FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
reliability
fault tolerance
reconcilitaion is required to make sure payment is consistent across system

can we use psp here instead of directly making payment ourself(requires lots of safety checks)
ESTIMATION:
1M transactions per day 
approx 10 transactions per second

Ledger is used to maintain consistency

DATABASE:
prefer sql database for reliability, performance is not the most important factor
on replicating data across multiple dbs, use quorum consensus to enforce that how many nodes we want to be updated when write happens

payment order table:
payment_order_id, buyer_account, payment_order_status, ledger_updated,wallet_updated

user:
user_name, user_id, email

NOTE:
PSP updates the payment status using a webhook connection

Reconcilitaion:
It is done using a settlement file provided by the psp and comparing it with our ledger file

Retry:
when user tries to do failed payment again and again, we can decide intervals between multiple failed attempt
• Immediate retry: client immediately resends a request.
• Fixed intervals: wait a fixed amow1t of time between the time of the failed payment and a new retry attempt.

Reliability:
•Scenario1: The payment system integrates with PSP using a hosted payment page and client clicks pay button twice
•Scenarlo 2: The payment is successfulJy processed by the PSP, but the response fails to reach our payment system due to network errors. 
The user clicks the "pay" button again or the client retries the payment.


Scenario1: handled using idempotency key
Scenario2: The nonce uniquely represents the payment order, and the token uniquely maps to the nonce. Therefore, the token uniquely maps to the payment order.

When a payment event is triggered, that event can be pushed to a queue like kafka, then it can be consumed by 
services like payment service,analytics service etc

Failed payments are pushed to dead letter queue

To prevent Man in middle attack, we use ssl certification

encrypt data at rest
encrypt data in transit using ssl

Data integrity:
we calculate checksum of the data in db and regularly checksum of same resources and compare it with earlier checksum
