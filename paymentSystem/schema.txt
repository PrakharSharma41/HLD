DATABASE:
prefer sql database for reliability, performance is not the most important factor
on replicating data across multiple dbs, use quorum consensus to enforce that how many nodes we want to be updated when write happens

payment order table: 
The payment order table stores the execution status ofeach payment order.
payment_order_id, buyer_account, payment_order_status, ledger_updated(boolean),wallet_updated(boolean)

payment event table:
The payment event table contains detailed payment event information.
checkout_id, buyer_info,seller_info, is_payment_done


user:
user_name, user_id, email

once payment_order_status is true, payment service calls wallet service to update that wallet and wallet_updated is set to true
it then calls ledger service to update the ledger_updated to true
