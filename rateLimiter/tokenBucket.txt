1. Each user has a two keys associated with them: the token bucket, and a timestamp of the last time the bucket was refilled.

2. When a user attempts to perform an action, we fetch the stored timestamp.

3. We calculate how many tokens the user should have been granted since that last request.

4. We can then proceed with the algorithm, using this new token count.
