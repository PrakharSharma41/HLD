for typeahead suggestion: suggest 3 words at a time based on current word

approx 1B unique search queries per day 

average search term is 20 characters = 4 words
• 20 bytes of data per query string:
• Assume we use ASCII character encoding. 1 character = 1 byte
• Assume a query contains 4 words, and each word contains 5 characters on average. • That is 4 x 5 = 20 bytes per query.
1B terms * 20 prefix = 20B entries map of prefix of search term to top 10 suggestions


On average, 20 requests are sent for each search query.

1B * 20/ 10^5 approx 200k tps

Assume 20% of the daily queries are new. 200 million  * 20 byte per query = 4 GB.
This means 4GB of new data is added to storage daily.
