audio can be represented as a spectogram(3d graph) time,frequency, amplitude
How does Shazam’s fingerprinting work (conceptually)?
Shazam uses a technique called landmark-based fingerprinting. Here’s the simplified process:

1️⃣ Spectrogram generation

Convert the audio snippet into a spectrogram (a 2D plot of frequency vs. time, where intensity shows amplitude).

2️⃣ Peak detection

Identify spectral peaks: points in the spectrogram where the frequency energy is strongest.

3️⃣ Landmark pairs

Form pairs of nearby peaks (anchor + target) with relative time and frequency differences.

Each pair becomes a hash, like:

ini
Copy
Edit
fingerprint = hash(frequency_anchor, frequency_target, time_difference)
This creates a set of fingerprints from a short recording.

4️⃣ Matching

These fingerprints are matched against fingerprints in the database.

If enough hashes from your recording match the same song, Shazam identifies it.
