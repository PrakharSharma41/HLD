Matching engine:
Matching cngine is also called the cross engine. Here are the primary responsibilities
of the matching engine:
1. Maintain the order book for each symbol. An order book is a list of buy and sell orders for a symbol. We explain lhe construction ofan order book in the Data models section later.
2. Match buy and sell orders. A match results in two executions (one from the buy side and the other from the sell side). 111e matching function must be fast and accurate.
3. Distribute the execution stream as market data.



Sequencer:
1. The sequencer is the key component that makes the matching engine deterministic. 
2. It stamps every incoming order with a sequence ID before it is processed by the match- ing engine. 


Market Data Flow:
1. The market data publisher (MDP) receives executions from the matching engine and builds the order books and candlestick charts from the stream of executions. 
2. The order books and candlestick charts, which we discuss in the Data Models section later, are collectively called market data 

Reporting Flow:
An incoming new order contains order details, and outgoing execution usually only contains order ID, price, quantity, and execution status. 
The reporter merges theattributes from both sources for the reports.

Client gateway:
1. The gatekeeper for the exchange.
2. Receives orders placed by clients and routes them to the order manager.
Functions:
    Authentication
    Validation
    Rate limiting
    Normalization
    FIXT support


The order manager, matching engine, and market data publisher each have their own application loop, each pinned to a dedicated CPU core.

They communicate via mmap â€” so when one component updates shared memory, others see the change instantly without going through the network or OS IPC mechanisms.
