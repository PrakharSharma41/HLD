An order represents the inbound instruction for a buy or sell order. 
An execution repre- sents the outbound matched result. 
An execution is also called a fill. Not every order has an execution. 
The output of the matching engine contains two executions, representing the buy and sell sides of a matched order.



In the critical trading path, orders and executions are not stored in a database. 
To achieve high performance, this path executes trades in memory and leverages hard disk or shared memory to persist and share orders and executions. 
Specifically, or- ders and executions are stored in the sequencer for fast recovery, and data is archived after the market closes.
