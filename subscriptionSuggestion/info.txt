Functional Requirements:
1. Dynamic Suggestion:
    1.1 Based on cart total, suggest a subscription tier (e.g., silver, gold, platinum).
    1.2 Update suggestion dynamically as the cart content changes (add/remove items, quantity changes).

2. Cart Integration:
    2.1 Subscription appears as a cart item (SKU-like) but unselected by default.
    2.2 User can manually select/deselect subscription.

3. Amount Calculation:
    3.1 Cart total should reflect the subscription price when selected and exclude it when deselected.

4. Subscription Lifecycle:
    4.1 Orchestration of subscription purchase (activation, expiry).
    4.2 Management (renewal, upgrade/downgrade, cancellation).

Non Functional Requirements:
1. Performance: Cart updates and suggestion recalculations must be near real-time (< 300ms).
2. Scalability: Suggestion Service should handle thousands of concurrent carts.
3. Auditability: All subscription lifecycle events must be logged for compliance.
