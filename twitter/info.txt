Should have a newsfeed feature consisting of tweets from the people the user is following.
Should be able to search tweets.

NON FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

DATABASE:

user:
user_id, name, email

follower:
follower_id, followee_id

tweet: 
activity_id, user_id, activity_time,created_at

comment:
activity_id, user_id,activity_time

activity_likes:
activity_id,like_count

we can store tweets and users information in nosql database
store followers data in graph database
we can shard data based on user_id because if a user want to see tweets of followers, service can search for shard containing 
that follower id

Retweets
Retweets are one of our extended requirements. To implement this feature, we can simply create a new tweet with the user id of the user retweeting the original tweet and
then modify the type enum and content property of the new tweet to link it with the original tweet.
