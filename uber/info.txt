FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
user should be able to input start and destination and show price
user should be able to request ride
driver should be able/deny request
driver nagivate to pickup/driveoff


NON FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
low latency matching
consistency of matching(driver to rider is 1 to 1 matching)
handle high throughput(for peak hours or special events)

CORE ENTITIES:
Driver, Ride, Rider, Location

API
POST /ride/fairEstimate ->returns {fare object}
{
    source: "",
    destination:""
}
PUT /ride/request -> 200  It initiates the ride matching process by signaling the backend to find a suitable driver
{
    fareId
}
POST /location/update
{
    lat,long
}
PUT /rides/:rideId // here we can send driverid in jwt token
{
    rideId,
    accept: true/false
}

PUT /ride/:rideId/update
{
    rideId,
    status: 'pickup' / 'dropoff'
}


DATABASE:
can be nosql, because we need high availability
rider:
rider_id, name, email

driver:
driver_id, cabid, email,location(in location db), status: inride/offline, request_sent(use redis instead of this)


ride:
rideid, riderid, driverid, fare, eta, source, destination

cab:
driverid, cabid, regNo

can use geospatial index in postgres

location:
driver_id, location
Redis provides geospatial commands like GEOADD for adding location data and GEOSEARCH for querying nearby locations within a given radius or bounding box. 

LOCATION SERVICE:
location service needs to be able to handle multipel transactions
because it will handle drivers location input
6M drivers
3M active drivers
driver sends location update every 5 seconds
3M/5 = 600KTPS

LOCATION DB:
1. cannot use lat and long attribute in sql database, query will be too wide
2. use geospatial index i.e quad trees, it is supported by postgress
3. to handle high tps, we can make location db in memory like redis, it 
can even handle  upto million TPS, redis also supports geohashing

quad trees are good when the data is unevenly distributed and
we have low updates because we will not need to reindex tree in each update

CONSISTENCY OF MATCHING:

1. we dont send more than one request at a time for a single ride:
ride matching service has a list of drivers, it will send notification
to driver using notification service sequentially using a while loop

2.we dont send any driver more than one request at a time:
each ride request can be on different ride matching service and to prevent 
same driver to receive request from multiple ride matching service, 
we need correlation between ride matching service(rms)
each rms sends request to driver only if request_sent in driver table is false


request_sent may be stuck if driver is not accepting the ride for some reason
to prevent this we can have a cron job that runs periodically and reset the status
if not updated


instead of using request_sent use redis and set driver id to true along 
with ttl

ride matching service can check if driver is available or not from redis

OPTIMIZATION
we can have a ride request queue before ride matching service 
this queue can be partioned by regions/location



How can we manage system overload from frequent driver location updates while ensuring location accuracy?
We can address this issue by implementing adaptive location update intervals, which dynamically adjust the 
frequency of location updates based on contextual factors such as speed, direction of travel, proximity to pending ride requests, and driver status.


How do we prevent multiple ride requests from being sent to the same driver simultaneously?
When a ride request is sent to a driver, a lock is created with a unique identifier (e.g., driverId) and a TTL set to the acceptance window duration of 10 seconds.


How can we ensure no ride requests are dropped during peak demand periods?
When a ride request comes in, it is added to the queue. The Ride Matching Service then processes requests from the queue in a first-come, first-served manner. 


What happens if a driver fails to respond in a timely manner?
    A Temporal workflow would:
    1. Send the ride request to the first driver
    2. Set a 10-second timeout
    3. If the driver accepts, complete the workflow
    4. If the driver declines or times out, automatically move to the next driver
    5. Continue this process until a driver is found or all drivers are exhausted


How nearby drivers are found?
Redis provides geospatial commands like GEOADD for adding location data and GEOSEARCH for querying nearby locations within a given radius or bounding box. 
These commands are highly optimized for geospatial data and can be used to efficiently handle real-time driver location updates and proximity searches

Every driverâ€™s location is updated in Redis using GEOADD
When a user requests a ride, the app queries nearby drivers using GEOSEARCH.

GEOADD locations 13.361389 38.115556 "Palermo"
GEOSEARCH locations FROMMEMBER "Palermo" BYRADIUS 100 km
