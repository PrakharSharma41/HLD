Using event-time windows, Flink groups all driver updates by (city_id, geohash_prefix, precision_level) in 1-min or 5-min windows.

Why Flink and Not Just Kafka Consumers?
1. Scalability: Flink parallelizes stream processing and can rebalance partitions.
2. Event-time windows: Unlike Kafka consumers, Flink guarantees correct aggregations even if events arrive late.
3. Stateful operators: Flink maintains driver counts in its internal state with RocksDB backend, fault-tolerant.
4. Exactly-once semantics: Ensures no double counting in Cassandra/Redis.
