FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
generate url
get url


Back of the envelope estimation

• Write operation: 100 million URLs are generated per day. 
• Write operation per second: 100 million / 24 /3600 = 1160
• Read operation: Assuming ratio of read operation to write operation is 10:1, read operation per second: 1160 * 10 = 11,600
• Assuming the URL shortener service will run for 10 years, this means we must support 100 million * 365 * 10 = 365 billion records.
• Assume average URL length is 100.
• Storage requirement over 10 years: 365 billion * 100 bytes * 10 years = 365 TB


301 redirect. 

A 301 redirect shows that the requested URL is “permanently” moved to the long URL. Since it is permanently redirected, 
the browser caches the response, and subsequent requests for the same URL will not be sent to the URL shortening service. 
Instead, requests are redirected to the long URL server directly.


302 redirect. A 302 redirect means that the URL is “temporarily” moved to the long URL, meaning that subsequent requests for the same URL will be sent to the URL shortening service first.
Then, they are redirected to the long URL server.
