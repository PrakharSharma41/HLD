Functional Requirements:
1. Each item is unique, tracked via a unique serial number (e.g., item_id or serial_number).
2. Warehouse maintains a collection of individual items, not just quantities.
3. Transfer means updating item ownership/location in the database, not physically shipping them.
4. Excel ingestion should map each item in the file to a unique record in DB.
5. Mismatch & lost items mean items recorded in DB but missing or misplaced physically — we must detect these via reconciliation.
6. No need to create transfer orders as for logistics — it’s a data operation.


Transfer Approach:
1. When moving an item from Warehouse A → Warehouse B:
2. Server receives request specifying item_id and destination warehouse_id.
3. Server validates that the item is currently in the source warehouse.
4. Server updates current_warehouse_id of the item in DB.
5. Insert a record into ItemTransferLog for audit trail.
6. No transfer order entity required — just an atomic DB update + logging.


Mismatch & Lost Item Tracking:
solved using reconciliation
1. Periodically or manually, perform reconciliation:
2. System runs a reconciliation job where physical scan (barcode/RFID) is compared with DB records.
3. If an item is physically absent but present in DB → mark status as LOST.
4. If an item is found in warehouse but DB says it belongs elsewhere → flag mismatch.
5. Insert discrepancies into InventoryReconciliation table.
